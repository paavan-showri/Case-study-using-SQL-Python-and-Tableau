Telecom Company Customer Churn Analysis considering Customer Lifetime values using SQL, Python and Tableau


The business problem is to analyse a telecom company that is concerned about losing its existing customers using factors

-   Using Python, missing values were removed and joined all the tables to create a single table with all the data given
-   After generating the combined dataframe, it was found that there was a significant difference in the Customer lifetime values (LTV) of the top 20% and           bottom 80% customers.
-   Complex analysis was performed to check which factors influence the LTVs of the customers

-   Bubble sort algorithm was implemented to sort the customers in decreasing order of their lifetime values (LTVs).
-   Then another function was created to tag the customers into high- and low-LTV groups.

-   Created multiple dashboards on the different services and their relation with contract, total charges (LTVs), monthly charges, tenure, and churn.
-   Finally, a Tableau story was created with all the dashboards created so far.
